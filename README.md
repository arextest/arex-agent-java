## Introduction


As your application evolves more complex, the effort required to thoroughly test against it also becomes tremendous. Arex is a framework designed around a quite straightforward principle of leveraging your real world data(i.e. database record, service payload, cache items etc.) for regression testing. Simple is powerful. The idea behind makes it incredibly powerful.

AREX provides an out-of-box agent file that could be attached to any applications with Java 8+ and dynamically weaves solid  bytecode into your existing code to record the real data of live traffic, and further use and replay it for mocking, testing, and debugging purpose.

AREX is implemented with an unique mechanism for recording. Instead of being a proxy like other similar framework, `AREX` sits in the background without awareness of your application to record realistic data in live traffic which means that no intrusive code changes are required when integrating it to your existing application.

AREX utilizes the advanced Java technique, Instrument API, and is capable of instrumenting various libraries and frameworks which are widely used.

**Libraries and frameworks supported by Arex (to be added...)**

## Building

Simply download the latest binary from [releases](https://github.com/arextest/arex-agent-java/releases) 
or build the artifacts with the following commands. The build process supports JDK 8 - 21.

`mvn clean install -DskipTests`

The `arex-agent.jar` is in the folder `arex-agent-jar/` after the build process.

If you wanna jar with version, build the artifacts with the following commands. 

`mvn clean install -DskipTests -Pjar-with-version`


## Getting Started


***Enable the instrumentation agent by configuring a `javaagent` flag to the JVM to run arex：***

AREX agent works along with the [AREX storage service](https://github.com/arextest/arex-storage).

You could just configure the host and port of them respectively, like below

```other
java -javaagent:/path/to/arex-agent.jar -Darex.service.name=my-service-name -Darex.storage.service.host=<storage.service.host:port> -jar my-application.jar
```


Alternatively, you can put those configuration item in `arex.agent.conf` file, like below

```other
arex.service.name=my-service-name
arex.storage.service.host=<storage.service.host:port> 
```


Then simply run:

```other
java -javaagent:/path/to/arex-agent.jar -Darex.config.path=/path/to/arex.agent.conf -jar my-application.jar
```


***Also, You can Run with CLI in local mode:***

Please refer to : [AREX standalone mode](https://github.com/arextest/arex-standalone).
